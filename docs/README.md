# Documentation

New users should follow the [first-run user guide](launching.md), from creating
an environment to receiving the first generated response. The
[README](../README.md#getting-started) provides a brief installation reference.

## Support and Runtime Notes

Supported models are Ouro-1.4B and Huginn-0125. Huginn currently uses synchronous
execution, LAST_EXITED KV, and fixed recurrent depth; prefix caching,
asynchronous execution, and speculative decoding are rejected. Its CUDA Graphs
capture the recurrent decode core and coda, including the LM head.
CPU execution provides a Torch
reference backend. FlashAttention hardware validation is currently documented
for FA4 on B300; FA2/FA3 require validation on their target devices. Disaggregated
serving currently targets multiple GPUs on a single host.

`ouro_delayed` reuses the trained Ouro gate with a one-loop delay; it changes
the exit policy. The `random_lookahead` mode uses an untrained head for runtime
experiments. Neither is a distilled lookahead predictor.
